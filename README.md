# Web-scrapping
This is an approach and a way of learning of web scraping as well as image scraping from scratch. In this project, we leverage web 
scraping techniques to extract data from websites. Web scraping is the process of automating the extraction of data from websites by 
simulating human browsing behavior. The extracted data will be saved in a specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON) in the output directory.

There is also use of tool Selenium which is an open-source software testing framework used for automating web browsers. It provides a way to automate interactions with web browsers, perform actions such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and extracting data, and verify the behavior and functionality of web applications.
